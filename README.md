# Fullstack training practice

## Contributing

### Use branching model

Create a new-branch
Use a separate branch for each feature or issue you work on. After creating a branch, check it out locally so that any changes you make will be on that branch.

```
git checkout -b [type]/new-feature-description
```

example:

```
git checkout -b feat/create-users-filter
```

Separate your commits for each small contribution, avoid to commit a lot of changes together.

### Use conventional commits
